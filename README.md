# BOOTSTRAP MY_WORLD



## Prerequisites

- **binary name:** _``model``_
- **language:** _C_
- **compilation:** via `Makefile`, including _``re``_, _``clean``_ and _``fclean``_ rules
- **Authorized functions:** `CSFML`

**Time to complete**: _2 hours_

## Project Overview

INTRODUCTION TO 3D PROJECTION

There are several interesting ways to simulate a 3-dimensional space: parallax scrolling, objects
shadowing, objects partially hidden by others or perspective projection. In this bootstrap, we will
go through a technique called isometric projection.

- Transform a 3D-map into a 2D-map
- Display a 2d wireframe
- Center the displayed map

## Objectives

Understand how to make 3D isometric in a 2D-map, by CSFML (Epitech).
    
## Compilation

You can compile the project using the provided Makefile:

```bash
make
```
It will generate a binary called ``asm``
